## DATABASE2

On my understanding, we should create and env file so that you will not manually input your DB_USER,PASSWORD etc. you just call it. env files allows us to put our environment variables inside a file.

## ERRORS
Make sure you already installed the .env "npm install --save dotenv" because i encountered that i run it then errors are responding then i realized that i didnt downloaded the .env yet
